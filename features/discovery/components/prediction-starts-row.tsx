// "Your Next Prediction Starts Here": two open markets, both leading to the
// prediction desk.
//
// The yellow card is the live one. It cycles through `markets` on a ten second
// timer, taking the countdown, the question, the collage and the first pill's
// destination from whichever market is up. Everything else on the card is fixed
// geometry and artwork. With no markets it renders the design's own sample: the
// Benny Hinn question and the two committed photos, with no clock, because there
// is no market whose deadline it could be showing. That sample is what the
// preview harness and the tests see, and what ships until a markets feed reaches
// the dashboard.
//
// Nothing rotates until the route hands this row markets. `app/(session)/(app)/
// dashboard/dashboard-page.tsx` renders it with none, so the dashboard shows the
// sample and runs no timer. The row cannot fetch them itself: discovery must not
// reach into the prediction feature, so the route maps its own hook's markets
// into `PredictionSpot` and passes them in, the way it already does for the
// token and memecoin shelves.
//
// Every clickable on the row is a `DiscoveryCta`, the heading link, or the
// market card's own stretched link, and the first two take their hover from
// `ws-pressable`. Nothing on these cards declares a hover of its own, and
// nothing carries a shadow at rest or on hover.
//
// The row rides a carousel: the market card, then one matchday card per fight
// on the book (2026-10-01: the title-fight card's design, with the fighters on
// it, in place of the generic belt card it used to deal), then the end cap,
// which is the only slide here that leaves for the prediction desk.

  // the row twice and the carousel clones its slides, so several copies can
