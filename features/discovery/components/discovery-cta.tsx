// padding, with 6px between the glyph and the label. Read as a share of the
// type that is 8/7em, 5/7em and 3/7em, and the rest of the set is the same
// shape drawn at its own size: the 17px Eth Africa pill gets 19.429/12.143
// instead of wearing the small pill's gutters.
//
// The measured numbers are also the floor. A 12px pill keeps the design's
// 16/10 rather than shrinking with the type, because the complaint that
// started this work was pills whose labels sat too close to the edge, and no
// pill should leave here tighter than the one the designer drew.

// Every discovery card ends in one of these: a rounded pill, black on the light
// cards and white on the dark ones, carrying the design's Mona Sans semibold.
//
// The pill sizes to its own label, so a longer locale widens it instead of
// cutting the label off. `max-w-full` is the backstop: once the pill has used up
// the box it was given, the label wraps and the pill gets taller rather than
// spilling over the card. Callers that want the design's width ask for it as a
// minimum (`min-w-[125px]`), never as a fixed `w-`, which would clip.
//
// The gutters survive that wrap because of the `min-w-0` on the label. Without
// it the label is a flex item at `min-width: auto`, which resolves to the width
// of its longest word, and a German compound long enough to beat the pill would
// refuse to shrink and push straight through the padding. At `min-width: 0` the
// item gives way, `break-words` breaks the compound, and the padding stays what
// it was: room that belongs to the box rather than slack a short English string
// happened to leave. The glyph is held out of that negotiation, so it keeps
// both its own size and its distance from the label.
//
// Hover is the one treatment used across the whole redesign: `ws-pressable`
// lifts and presses the pill and nothing else moves. No shadow on hover; the
// resting shadows some cards pass in are design-verified and stay.
