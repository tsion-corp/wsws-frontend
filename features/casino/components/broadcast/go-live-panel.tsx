// The "go live" control for any casino activity. Nothing here knows which
// game it is attached to: the caller owns the broadcast (so it can decide who
// is allowed to start one) and passes it in, along with the two sentences that
// have to name what is being shared.
//
// The panel reads the broadcast out of context rather than taking it as a
// prop, because a layout may render the panel more than once. The chess round
// view keeps a mobile column and a desktop rail in the DOM at the same time
// and hides one with CSS, so the panel appears twice. One broadcast must not
// become two LiveKit rooms, so the provider is mounted once above both.
//
// Composition note: the screen share and the camera go up as two separate
// LiveKit tracks rather than one composited frame. Compositing here would mean
// drawing both into a canvas and publishing that, which costs a frame copy per
// tick and freezes the layout at the source. Publishing both and letting the
// Market Square viewer draw the camera over the screen is the picture-in-
// picture convention Twitch and chess.com streamers use, and it leaves the
// layout the viewer's to change. The viewer tells them apart by track source.
