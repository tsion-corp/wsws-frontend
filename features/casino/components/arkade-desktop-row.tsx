/**
 * One row of the desktop Arkade catalogue (node 173:47144): three game cards
 * side by side, 13px apart, each 203.8px tall at the 20px corner.
 *
 * The comp draws each card 370px wide inside a 1038px strip, which does not
 * fit: 3x370 plus two gaps is 1136px, so the comp's own third card is sliced
 * vertically with half a Play button. That is a file defect, not a spec, so the
 * width is not transcribed. The row is a three-column grid that divides
 * whatever container it is given, which keeps the comp's rhythm and card height
 * while never slicing a card at any width. See the report for the ruling this
 * needs.
 *
 * The card itself is ArkadeGameCard, the same one the phone list draws. This
 * file owns the rail: how many cards, how they are spaced, and what an empty or
 * loading rail looks like.
 *
 * Presentational only. Games arrive as props, and opening one is the caller's
 * job through `onSelectGame`.
