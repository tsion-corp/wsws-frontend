// price to multiply by any more. A USDC amount IS a dollar amount; an ETH
// amount needs the ETH price.
//
// Getting this wrong is not subtle. A 0.38 USDC pot priced at the ETH price
// showed as $925.68, and the same pot with no price at all showed as $0.00 —
// both seen on 2026-09-15, in the same game, on two different screens.
//
// The service's own `usdValue` is native-only by its contract and comes back as
// 0 for a token game, so it cannot be trusted as "already priced" either.
