 * Two rows are not, and both come back with a 200 rather than a 404, so the
 * retry loop below never saw either of them:
 *
 * - The ALL-ZERO row. The service answers for a game its index has not reached
 *   by reading the contract, and that read can land a block or two before the
 *   start transaction. The id is real, the round has not begun: no pot, no end
 *   time, not active.
 * - A SETTLED row. A game the caller created a moment ago cannot already be
 *   over. This is the legacy contract showing through: ids repeat across
 *   contract generations, v4 ran past 400 while v5 has only just passed 190,
 *   so an id in that window still answers with v4's long-settled ETH game
 *   until v5's own row is indexed (checked live on 2026-09-23: 194 served a
 *   settled v4 row, and 193 served the v5 row once it existed).
