// The Market design's phone Prediction tab (Figma 1:16194): the market cards
// stacked in one column under this tab's own search field. Each card is a
// coloured header band carrying the market's artwork and question, the two
// outcomes as rows below it, and a footer of volume and close date.
//
// The search field belongs to this list rather than to the Market page around
// it. The page used to pin one shared field above the tab strip and disable it
// here, because this list took no query and could not filter; now every tab owns
// a working field that scrolls away with its own rows.
//
// The comp draws three cards, two of them with several named outcomes. This
// deployment's markets are binary: one Yes and one No per market, which is what
// the feed carries and what the CLOB can price. So every card is the comp's
// third variant, the one with a Predict Yes row and a Predict No row.
//
// Two things the comp shows are not in the feed and are therefore not drawn: the
// trade count ("7.1k Trades") and the sample volume and names. Volume comes from
// the feed's own figure through the money layer, the close date from the feed's
// own timestamp, and both elements are absent when the feed states neither.
