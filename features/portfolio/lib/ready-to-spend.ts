// The card has to carry that distinction the whole way to the screen, because
// the figure gates the withdraw button: an unknown balance flattened to 0
// satisfies `readyToSpend < OFFRAMP_MIN_USDC` and shuts the button on someone
// who has money, with no error anywhere to explain it. Everything below exists
// to stop a `?? 0` being written at any point between the hook and the render.
//
// Pure: no framework, no network, so the rule the button hangs on is unit
// tested on its own.

 * are kept apart rather than folded into one absent value because they are
 * different sentences to show a reader: a figure on its way is a skeleton, a
 * figure we could not get is "couldn't load". The card already draws exactly
 * that distinction for the headline total (see its `errored` comment) and this
 * follows it.

 * spendableCash(). The card's formatter takes a `number` (money.format, which
 * also applies an FX rate that is itself a float), so the conversion has to
 * happen somewhere; it happens here, once, named, at the moment the figure
 * stops being money and becomes text. No caller may do it a second time, and
 * nothing downstream of this function does arithmetic on the result.
 *
 * The loss is bounded and harmless AT THIS EDGE: a double holds about 15
 * significant digits, the figure is rendered to two, and the withdraw
 * comparison it feeds is against a whole dollar (OFFRAMP_MIN_USDC). It would
 * NOT be harmless upstream, which is why spendableCash returns a string.

 * balance that has not landed yet would render as "couldn't load" on every
 * cold paint. `error` is the failed read, which is the one case that is
 * genuinely unknown rather than merely early.

 * Whether a settling bank deposit holds the withdraw button shut.

 * The hold exists so an unchanged balance next to a live button does not read
 * as "withdraw your new money now" and invite repeated attempts. It applies
 * only while there is nothing withdrawable: someone whose spendable cash
 * already clears the minimum can legitimately withdraw and keeps the button.
 *
 * AN UNKNOWN FIGURE NEVER HOLDS THE BUTTON. It is not evidence of an empty
 * wallet — it is the absence of evidence either way — and the two failures are
 * not symmetric. Holding wrongly locks a real balance behind a disabled
 * control that explains nothing; releasing wrongly shows a live button to
 * someone with nothing, who gets the withdrawal flow's own minimum-amount
 * refusal a step later. The flow can say no. A disabled button cannot say why.
