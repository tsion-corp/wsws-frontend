// The phone's ledger strip from the 2.0 "Leverage Trading" frame (Figma
// 1:7580, nodes 1:7722-1:7733): a row of pill-shaped tabs over a 3px rule, with
// a white segment of that rule under the selected one.
//
// Geometry from the comp: 101px tabs, 8px apart, a 12px SemiBold label at
// -0.36px tracking, #f4f4f4 when selected and white at 40% otherwise, and a
// 3px rule at rgba(255,255,255,0.08) with the selected segment in solid white.
// The one deliberate departure is height. The comp's tab is 38px, which is
// under the 44px a thumb needs, and this strip is the phone's only way between
// the ledgers, so the button is 44px tall and the rule still sits on its
// bottom edge. Nothing else moves.
//
// It is a real tablist: role="tablist"/role="tab" with aria-selected, one
// role="tabpanel" tied to the selected tab both ways, and a roving tabindex so
// a keyboard user steps into the strip once and arrows across it. Home and End
// jump to the ends.
//
// Presentational and self-contained. It takes labels already translated and
// panels already built, so it knows nothing about orders, positions or the
// venue, and it fetches nothing.
//
// This is the third hand-rolled tablist in the tree, after
// components/ui/tabs.tsx and the market strip in
// features/trade/components/mobile-market-view.tsx. All three should collapse
// into one primitive under components/ui/ once the screens in flight have
// landed; features cannot import each other, so none of them can reuse another
// where it sits today.
