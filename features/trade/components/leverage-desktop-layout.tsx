// Applied any wider than that, this height is the bug it was reported as: a
// market card at the top of the panel and several hundred pixels of black under
// it.
//
// It is a definite height, `h-`, and it must stay one. It was `min-h-[924px]`
// and that is what cut the chart off. Everything between this column and the
// chart frame takes its height from `flex-1`, and CSS only treats a flexed
// height as definite when the container it flexed inside had a definite height
// itself. Under a `min-h-` column the whole chain stays indefinite, so the
// TradingView iframe, which is drawn at `height: 100%`, cannot resolve its
// percentage and falls back to an iframe's default 150px: the toolbar, a sliver
// of candles, the date row, then black to the bottom of a panel that is itself
// the right size. Measured in headless Chrome at 1440px wide, with the market
// card at 116px: the frame is 721px either way, and the iframe inside it goes
// from 150px under `min-h-[924px]` to 719px under `h-[924px]`.
const MARKET_COLUMN_HEIGHT = "min-[1080px]:h-[924px]";

// Makes the chart panel fill the height the left panel leaves it, rather than
// the flat 220px ChartPanelShell draws by default.
//
// The height cannot be passed as a prop from here: the chart arrives as an
// already-built node in the `chart` slot, so the shell's `height` prop belongs
// to the route, not to this file. What this shell can do is hand the chart the
// space, and the three rules below turn the shell's fixed frame into a flex
// child that takes it:
//
//   [&>*]                            the ChartPanelShell root, stretched to the
//                                    region so its own column has real height
//   [data-region=chart-panel-frame]  the shell's bordered frame, whose inline
//                                    style={{ height }} only `!` can beat
//
// `min-h-[220px]` is CHART_PANEL_SHELL_HEIGHT from chart-panel-shell.tsx, kept
// as the frame's floor so the chart never collapses: with `h-auto` in place of
// the inline height, a panel that is not being stretched by the column would
// otherwise resolve the frame to nothing, and a TradingView iframe inside a
// zero-height box draws nothing at all.
//
// These rules replace the shell's real number with a flexed height, so they only
// work while the chain above them is definite: MARKET_COLUMN_HEIGHT's `h-`, then
// `flex-1` on the panel, on the chart block, on this region, on the shell root
// and on the frame, with nothing in between switching back to `min-h-` or
// `h-auto`. Break one link and the frame still looks right while the chart
// inside it drops to 150px. Read the note on MARKET_COLUMN_HEIGHT before
// touching any of them.
//
// Gated at min-[1080px] on purpose. Below the breakpoint the columns stack into
// an ordinary scrolling page, no column height applies, and the shell's own
// 220px is the right height.

// The desktop leverage-trading shell: a search rail, then a left panel holding
// the market identity with the chart filling the rest of it, beside a single
// order ticket that stacks entry, summary and the Buy/Sell actions. Geometry
// only. Every region is a slot the route fills with the panels that already
// exist, so nothing here fetches, polls, prices, sizes or submits anything, and
// the order-entry maths stays where it already lives.
//
// Column widths, panel radii and the 16/12px rhythm come from the "Leverage
// trading, opened charts" frame (Figma 173:42963). The chart sits in the left
// column rather than inside the ticket: a TradingView frame in a 470px ticket is
// nearly all toolbar, while the left column runs to roughly 950px at a 1440px
// viewport.
//
// The left column is ONE panel, not a stack of cards. The market identity sits
// at its top at its own height, and the chart takes everything under it inside
// the same bordered surface. The earlier version made these two separate
// bordered blocks and gave the market panel the growth, which put a small market
// card at the top of a tall empty panel and pushed the chart out below it as a
// second card. That empty area is exactly where the chart belongs.
//
// The split is minmax(560px,1fr) for the panel against a fixed 470px ticket. The
// design pins the list at 602px against a 1047px frame; 560px is taken as its
// floor instead, and it still absorbs any extra width, because this surface runs
// up to 1920px in the app and a fixed panel would leave a dead gutter.
//
// Two columns only from 1080px (560 + 16 gutter + 470 ticket needs 1046, the
// same slack the old 602/430 split had at 1048, so the breakpoint is unchanged).
// Below it everything stacks and scrolls as an ordinary page: this is the
// desktop design, and a 470px ticket next to a 560px panel has nowhere narrower
// to go.
