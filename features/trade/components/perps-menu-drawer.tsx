 * The perps screen's way back into the rest of the app.
 *
 * Perps is immersive: it mounts no shell, so it has no rail and no topbar.
 * This is the hamburger that stands where the Portfolio back link used to,
 * plus the app's real Sidebar mounted on its own as an overlay. Not a second
 * drawer: the rail already behaves exactly this way as the phone drawer, so
 * it gets the same `open`/`onClose` pair here and brings its slide, its dimmed
 * backdrop, its scroll lock, its Escape handler and its close-on-choice with
 * it. The entries come from buildNav, so a section hidden from the rail
 * (Real assets today, via HIDDEN_NAV_SECTIONS) is hidden here too.
 *
 * The rail is written for two states, a phone drawer and a fixed desktop rail,
 * and pins itself open from `md` up. Perps wants the drawer at every width, so
 * the wrapper below re-points the four `md:` utilities that would otherwise
 * pin it: the sidebar's translate, its width and its z-index, and the
 * backdrop's and close button's display. Descendant selectors, so they win on
 * specificity without the rail needing to know this screen exists.
