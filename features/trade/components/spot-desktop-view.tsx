// The two columns. The ticket column holds the order form and its controls, so

//
// The split changed on user feedback: the list was too wide and the ticket too
// narrow for what it carries. The ticket is now 40% of the content column,
// floored at the 430px it used to be and capped at 480px. Measured in the app
// shell, that is 430px below about a 1390px window, 451px at 1440px, and 480px
// from 1512px up to the container's 1520px maximum, where the list takes 960px
// instead of the 1010px it had. The floor is what keeps the desk's minimum
// width where it was, since nothing below 1390px gets narrower. The list carries
// 410px of fixed price, change and market cap columns, so at the xl breakpoint
// it is already down to 522px, and taking another 50px off the asset name there
// would leave it nothing to sit in.
//
// One track rather than a second breakpoint: Tailwind emits an arbitrary
// `min-[1440px]:` rule ahead of the named `xl:` one, so a wider track declared
// that way loses to the narrower one at every width. Measured, not assumed.
//
// The row stretches, and the market list is the panel that answers to it.
// SpotAssetTable carries `self-stretch` and grows the region above its pager, so
// it fills the row and reaches the bottom of the window.
//
// The ticket opts out with `self-start` on the aside itself. It was stretching
// too, which on a 900px window left roughly 110px of empty card between the
// quick amounts and the purchase summary the `mt-auto` block pins to the foot.
// The stretch is removed at the one panel that must not have it rather than by
// turning the whole row to `items-start`: the row's alignment is then still the
// grid default that anything else dropped into it inherits, and the list does
// not end up relying on its own `self-stretch` alone to fill the window.
//
// `grow` is the last link in the chain that carries the viewport's height down
// to the panels: the desk container is at least a screen tall from xl up, the
// column inside it grows to that height, and this grid takes what the search
// field leaves. A grid whose single implicit row is auto sized stretches that
// row to fill the container, and `items-stretch` then hands the height to the
