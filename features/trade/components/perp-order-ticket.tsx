// The 2.0 desktop perps ticket (Figma 173:42920 / 173:42963): the pair strip,
// price, quantity, the risk settings, optional take profit / stop loss, the
// position summary, and Buy / Sell. It replaces HyperliquidOrderForm's
// Cross/5x pills, percent slider and single Place Order button on this surface.
//
// Presentational only. Nothing here fetches, quotes, or prices anything: every
// figure arrives as a prop and every action leaves as a callback. The
// order-entry maths stays with whoever already owns it.
//
// Money rules this file follows, and why each one:
//
//   * The quantity is a decimal string ("0.123456"), never a number. Parsing
//     it to a float and printing it back loses digits well inside the range a
//     collateral balance reaches, and an 18-decimal asset loses them at the
//     first wei. The same holds for the price and for both trigger prices.
//   * The balance arrives as bigint base units, so the comparison that gates
//     Buy and Sell is two bigints, not two doubles.
//   * Order value, entry price, estimated liquidation and the opening fee
//     arrive display-ready. Liquidation in particular is a risk figure: it is
//     never worked out here, only shown, and when the caller has none it is
//     drawn as an explicit "unavailable" rather than as a zero or a dash that
//     a trader could read as a real level. There are two of them, one per
//     direction, because a long and a short break on opposite sides of entry
//     and this ticket does not choose a direction until the click. The caller
//     gets both from estimateLiquidationPrice in features/trade/lib/liquidation.
//     The older
//     liquidationPrice() in lib/trade/math is wrong (float maths, a hardcoded
//     100x maintenance rate, no venue denominator) and is dead code; nothing
//     on this surface may revive it.
//   * Formatting the balance line works on the digits of a string. No
//     arithmetic, so there is nothing to round.
//
// The quantity gate is spotAmountStatus from the spot ticket rather than a
// second implementation. It is the same problem (is this decimal string
// spendable out of this bigint balance at this many decimals) and it carries a
// mutation-tested guarantee; a parallel copy here would be a second answer to
// one question.
//
// What this ticket deliberately does NOT own:
//
//   * The chart. On perps it lives in the left column and owns its own expand
//     control, so the ticket carries no chart slot and no "View Chart"
//     disclosure. A second chart control inside the ticket would be a control
//     that fights the layout around it.
//   * Top up and Withdraw. They move USDC in and out of the perps account,
//     need the wallet id and the clearinghouse's withdrawable figure, and each
//     opens its own modal. None of that is order entry. The composer renders
//     them beside this ticket; nothing here is exposed for them.
//   * Whether a take profit sits on the right side of entry. That answer
//     depends on the direction, and this design picks the direction at the
//     moment of the click rather than up front, so only the composer can judge
//     it. It reports the verdict back through sideBlockedReasons.
