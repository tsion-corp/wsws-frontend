/**
 * A "do more" control on the Square page: a pill that opens the Square on
 * exactly the room, person, house or post the card shows.
 *
 * The SAME TAB. The name says outbound and it is not: the Square is served
 * under /square on this origin as a multi-zone, so these pills stay on
 * tsionark.com and hand the reader to the Square's own code with their session
 * intact. They used to open square.tsionark.com in a second tab, which both
 * changed the sub-domain and left the app behind in the tab they came from.
 *
 * A plain anchor rather than a `next/link`: the zone is another app, and this
 * router has no route there to transition to (lib/square-zone).
 *
 * Renders nothing without an address: a pill that goes nowhere is worse than
 * no pill, the rule every cross-product link in this app follows.
 *
 * Three looks, the three the Square's Home draws:
 *   · create: the purple ramp Home puts on its one action per card, with the
 *     voice glyph after the label ("Join Gistroom");
 *   · quiet: a 5% white pill in a 20% ring ("Open the Square");
 *   · viewMore: the Square's own "View more" pill beside a heading, in its
 *     Manrope with its purple chevron export.
 *
 * The ramp's two purples are the Square's own, stated here once.
