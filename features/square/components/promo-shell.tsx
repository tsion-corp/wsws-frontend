/**
 * The shared frame for a Market Square block sitting between dashboard
 * sections.
 *
 * These exist to recruit: someone reading their portfolio meets a little of
 * the square on the way down, rather than having to reach the very bottom of
 * the page to discover it exists. So each block is ONE horizontal rail — it
 * costs a fixed slice of height however much it has to show, and it never
 * interrupts the vertical read for long.
 *
 * The cards deliberately keep Market Square's own palette (its card grey, its
 * blue verification, its red live dot) rather than Ark's monochrome. They are
 * a window into another product, and looking slightly foreign is the point:
 * it reads as "this is the square", not as another Ark widget.
