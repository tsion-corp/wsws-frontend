      "Ark is a platform for global markets. Through it you can hold and move crypto, trade spot and perpetual markets, buy tokenised real world assets, take positions in prediction markets, play games in Arkade, earn and convert Kash+ rewards, and take part in Market Square, our social and streaming layer.",
      "This policy explains what personal information we collect when you use Ark, why we collect it, who we share it with, and what you can ask us to do with it. It covers the Ark website and web application at tsionark.com and the services reachable from them.",
      "It does not cover the independent services you may reach through Ark. Public blockchains, the venues that execute your trades, and the payment providers that move your local currency each handle data on their own terms. Where that matters we say so, and we name them.",

      "We collect four kinds of information, and the amount depends on how far into the platform you go. Browsing the public site involves almost none of it. Withdrawing to a Nigerian bank account involves the most.",
      "Account and identity. When you create an account we use Privy, our authentication provider, to verify you. Depending on the method you choose, that means your email address, or the basic profile a Google or X sign in returns, or a passkey held on your own device. We receive an account identifier from Privy and the wallet addresses created for you.",
      "Financial and transactional. The wallet addresses associated with your account, the assets you hold, the trades, deposits, withdrawals, wagers and predictions you make, and the state those transactions reach. Some of this we store. Much of it we read from public blockchains at the moment you look at it, and never hold at all.",
      "Identity verification, where the law requires it. To deposit or withdraw Nigerian naira, our provider Pouch Finance must verify your identity. The fields depend on what they ask for at the time and typically include your full name, date of birth, a national identification number, an email address confirmed with a one time code, and your bank account details. We send these to Pouch to be checked. We do not use them for anything else.",
      "Usage and device. Pages you open, features you use, approximate location derived from your IP address, and standard technical details such as browser type, device type, language and time zone. Some of our services are restricted by country, and this is how that restriction is applied.",

      "Both identify a session by your EVM wallet address, never by your email address. The address is already the identifier your on chain activity carries, so using it adds nothing that the chain does not already expose, and it keeps your email out of an analytics vendor.",
      "Screens that handle sensitive data are excluded from recording at the source. Identity verification, bank withdrawal, and bank transfer screens are marked so that Clarity records a placeholder in place of the values you type. Mixpanel does not capture what you type or click at all: it receives only named events, such as a completed deposit or trade, with amounts and never account numbers. Your identity documents, bank details and account numbers are not in any replay or event.",
