// The phone Market page (Figma 173:42337): a full-screen Spot trading view with
// its own MARKET head, standalone from the app shell. It lives in (session) —
// not (app) — so it gets the wallet providers without the topbar/sidebar/tab
// bar that the shell would otherwise wrap every product route in.
//
// Standalone, though, meant no bottom nav: the reader reached Market from the
// tab bar and then had no tab bar to leave it by. So this page carries that one
// piece of the shell itself — the curved bottom bar — wired to the same nav and
// the same navigate the shell uses. The Market icon reads active while here.
