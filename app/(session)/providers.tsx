 * product routes and the games, and persists across every navigation among
 * them. It used to sit in the root providers, which put the wallet SDK, viem
 * and livekit-client, over a megabyte of JavaScript, in front of the landing
 * page and the privacy policy. Neither uses any of it.
 *
 * Privy is no longer mounted here (ADR-0009). The two surfaces that must still
 * sign with the OLD Privy wallets — the Update Balance sweep and
 * /prediction/reclaim — mount LegacyPrivyProvider themselves, so the legacy SDK
 * loads only for the users who still have something to move. That is also why
 * the Solana RPC wiring Privy needed is gone: the kit takes its chains from
 * config and reads through our own proxy.
