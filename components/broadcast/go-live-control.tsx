// Mobile: the centre node of the existing tab bar, a ringed circle breaking
// the bar's top edge. It reads as floating without floating: Material 3 is
// explicit that a FAB must not obstruct the navigation bar, and a genuinely
// free-floating button permanently covers content underneath it. This gets the
// affordance with none of the occlusion, and lands in the thumb zone by
// construction.
//
// Desktop: pinned at the top of the rail above a divider, never an overlay.
//
// Always icon AND label. A bare icon here would be mystery meat, and this
// button starts a public broadcast of somebody's trading screen.
