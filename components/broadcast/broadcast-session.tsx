// The one broadcast session in the app, mounted above the router.
//
// This is the whole reason the provider lives here rather than inside a
// screen. A LiveKit room is held by the component that created it, so a room
// created by the chess board dies the moment the user navigates to their
// portfolio. Ark's premise is that a broadcast covers ANY surface, so the room,
// its tracks, the stream it is publishing to and every piece of session state
// live above the router and survive every route change.
//
// What the session owns:
//  - the room and its tracks (through `useBroadcastRoom`)
//  - the Market Square stream lifecycle: create, go live, end
//  - attaching to somebody else's stream as an approved guest
//  - the financial-data guard: suspending video on a sensitive route
//  - page lifecycle: backgrounding, unload, reconnect, auto-end
//
// What it does not own: how a caller found the stream to join, and what a
// particular game wants to call itself. Those stay with the caller.
