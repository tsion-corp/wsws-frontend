// It lives here rather than under features/trade because none of the rule it

// ONE button, for the side the switch above has chosen. It used to render both
// at once, and that was the bug: a single amount field cannot be denominated in
// USDC and in the coin at the same time, so whichever button you were not
// looking at was reading the other leg's number as its own. Typing 100 to buy
// $100 of a coin had the Sell button reading it as 100 coins and refusing on a
// balance that had nothing to do with it.
//
// Each side is still gated against its own asset. Buying spends the pay token,
// so Buy is gated on the pay balance. Selling draws down the asset being sold
// and needs no pay balance at all, so gating Sell on the pay token would strand
// a user who holds the asset but little USDC: they could not close the
// position. A sell is the way out of a position, so its gate must be about the
// thing being sold and nothing else.
//
// Neither button is ever a silently dead control: whenever one is disabled a
// line says why and names the asset it is short of, and every button points at
// its reason through aria-describedby so it reaches a screen reader too.
