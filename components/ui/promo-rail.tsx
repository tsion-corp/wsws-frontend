// Frame 1:11444 lays its three banners out as a scroller of equal cards: 515,
// 515.768 and 512 wide, 22 apart, 1586.77 of content inside a 1001 row. Their
// heights disagree by a few pixels because the designer resized each by hand,
// but the two drawn as artwork agree on a ratio to four decimals (515.768 / 88
// and 512 / 87.3571 are both 5.861), so that is the card's shape.
//
// The rail row in the design (node 1:11445) measures 93.2367, but that figure
// is a bounding box, not a banner height. Its tallest banner, Set the stake,
// draws both of its stub edges from the same 27.4179 x 91.7082 export, and the
// left one is placed 1.5285 lower than the right, so the row's box comes out as
// one ticket plus that offset. The ticket is 91.7082, and that is the height
// the banners were measured at.
//
// Nothing renders at this size. The rail is a carousel now, and it sizes its
// slides to fill the rail's width, so a banner is whatever width the slide is.
// These two numbers stay because every measurement inside a banner is written
// as a share of them: the card scales as one piece, which is the only way to
// resize a banner whose stub edges are a column of circles.
