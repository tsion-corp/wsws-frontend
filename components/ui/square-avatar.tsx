/**
 * A square member's picture, rendered EXACTLY as Market Square renders it.
 *
 * Three tiers, in the square's own order:
 *   1. `src` — the person's own upload. Always wins.
 *   2. Seeded artwork — one of the nine ARK mascots, chosen by a stable hash
 *      of the identity (see lib/square/avatar-seed.ts).
 *   3. A neutral monogram — only when nothing identifies the row at all.
 *
 * Ark's shared `Avatar` draws a geometric identicon, which meant the same
 * account showed a mascot in the square and a pattern of blocks here. Two
 * faces for one person reads as two people, and it undermines the whole point
 * of surfacing the square's content on this dashboard.
 *
 * It sits in `components/ui` rather than the square slice because the account
 * chrome draws it too — the sidebar, topbar, popover and account modal all
 * show the player their own square face, and `components/layout` may not
 * import a feature.
 *
 * `seed` must be the STABLE identity — the Privy DID — not a display name.
 * Seeding on a name re-rolls someone's avatar the moment they rename.
