// a browser that has signed out, or signed in as someone without a wallet on
// this chain, must not inherit the address the cookie named when the page
// rendered. Falling back on null here was the review finding that a stale
// server wallet could outlive the session that produced it.
//
// An EVM address is lowercased so the query key built from it is stable across
// the server→Privy transition. The server SDK and the browser SDK return the
// same wallet but can disagree on EIP-55 checksum casing, and a casing change
// is a new query key — which triggers a duplicate fetch on every cold entry.
// A Solana address is left exactly as it came: base58 carries meaning in its
// case, so a folded one names a different account, or none.
