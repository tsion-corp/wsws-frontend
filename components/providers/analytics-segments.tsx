/**
 * Keeps the super properties in step with what the app knows about the account.
 *
 * KYC status is not set here: this provider sits above the features and must
 * not read their state. The KYC screen reports its own status instead, which
 * is also the only place that can tell "pending" from "not started".
 *
 * Mixpanel attaches these to every event, so a funnel can be sliced by
 * verification, balance and tier without each call site passing them through.
 *
 * This listens to the query cache rather than calling usePortfolio. That hook
 * owns the balance poll, and mounting it here, above every route, kept the
 * poll and its Alchemy read running on the perps desk, in the casino, on
 * every page, purely to feed a segment. A segment needs the latest total the
 * app happens to know, not a subscription of its own. Listening costs no
 * request: the value updates whenever a page that shows the balance loads
 * it, and stays put otherwise.
 *
 * Renders nothing.
