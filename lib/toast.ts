   * NOT reach it. A toast that names an amount will be broadcast in full
   * unless it says so here.
   *
   * The rule: if the message interpolates an amount, a balance, a payout or an
   * address, pass `sensitive: true`. If it does not, leave it off. Prefer
   * wording that needs no number at all where the number adds nothing
   * ("Transfer sent" rather than "Transfer of 4 USDC sent"); pass this flag
   * when the number IS the confirmation, which is the usual case for money
   * actually moving.
