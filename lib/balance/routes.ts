// The user-management balance path, written down once. It goes through the
// same-origin proxy (app/api/user-management), so the browser never holds a
// gateway URL and never holds the service's base path either.
//
// The id is the account's id as the services know it: a Decane user id (a
// UUID), or a Privy DID on a legacy session. A DID contains colons, and an id
// from elsewhere could contain anything, so it is encoded as exactly one path
// segment — the same rule lib/notifications/routes.ts states and for the same
// reason: that encoding is what stops a crafted id from addressing a path the
// proxy's allowlist never admitted.
//
// Deliberately not an entry in NOTIFICATION_ROUTES. A balance is not a
// notification; the two only share a URL prefix because one service serves
// both, and folding this in there would make every later reader of that file
// believe otherwise.
