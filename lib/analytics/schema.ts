// The event catalog as data, so it can be checked at runtime.
//
// ./events is the catalog as types. TypeScript enforces it at every call site,
// which is most of the job, but it stops at the boundary where a value's type
// is asserted rather than known: a figure parsed out of an API response, a
// number that arrived as a decimal string, anything cast on the way in. Those
// reach Mixpanel looking exactly like a violation of the spec, and nothing
// fails until someone tries to sum a column of quoted numbers weeks later.
//
// So the shapes are restated here as data and checked against what actually
// goes on the wire. Two things keep this from drifting away from ./events:
//
//   - EVENT_SCHEMA is typed Record<AnalyticsEventName, ...>, so an event added
//     to the catalog without a shape here does not compile.
//   - The suite validates the catalog and rejects a deliberately malformed
//     event, so CI fails rather than the data quietly rotting.
//
// This is what makes the spec enforceable instead of merely written down.
