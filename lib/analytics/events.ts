// The product analytics catalog. Every event the app sends is named here, with
// the properties it carries, so a screen cannot invent a name, misspell one, or
// drift from the agreed shape without failing the build.
//
// Conventions, enforced by the types below and by `track`:
//   - event names are snake_case and past tense: `trade_completed`
//   - property names are snake_case
//   - numbers go unquoted; a property with no value is omitted, never sent as
//     null, "" or "N/A" (see `track` in ./mixpanel)
//   - one action is one event; variants are a property (`vertical`, `scope`),
//     not a second event name
//
// Never add a property here that could carry a NIN, BVN, bank account or
// virtual account number, transfer reference, OTP, passkey or key material.
// Those are identity-theft and account-drainage grade, and NIN/BVN are NDPR
// crown jewels. Contact details (email, name) are governed profile fields set
// once on identify, never event properties.
