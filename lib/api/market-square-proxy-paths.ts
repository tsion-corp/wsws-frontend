// Reads. `me` tells us whether the player carries the creator role that
// POST /streams demands; the stream read is how the panel reflects a status
// the service changed underneath us, such as the orphan reaper ending a
// stream after the host disconnected.
// `streams` is the discovery read: given a deep-link ref it answers with every
// live stream pointing at that activity, which is how a second player finds
// the broadcast their opponent already started. `speaker-requests` is the
// host's pending queue, and `speaker-requests/me` is the guest's own request,
// which carries the publishing credentials once it is approved.

 * Reads that need NO session, because the square serves them to anyone.
 *
 * Ark's proxy demands a verified session on every path by default, which is
 * right for a relay that forwards the caller's identity — but it silently made
 * the dashboard's whole square section a 401 for signed-out readers, and for
 * signed-in ones during the moment before Privy warms up. The feed upstream is
 * `optionalAuth`: it answers anybody, and enriches the answer when a token
 * comes with it.
 *
 * So these three are exempt from OUR session check only. The caller's token is
 * still forwarded whenever there is one, so `likedByMe` and the rest keep
 * resolving — a signed-out reader simply sees the same posts without the
 * viewer state. Everything else, including anything under /me, still requires
 * a session here before a single byte is forwarded.
