/**
 * Sections kept out of the navigation.
 *
 * A visibility switch, not a removal, the way MARKET_SQUARE_HIDDEN in
 * lib/market-square.ts is. Everything behind a listed id stays wired: its
 * route, its slice, its holdings in the portfolio breakdown. The id is only
 * not offered as a way in.
 *
 * buildNav in components/layout/nav-items.tsx is the single reader, so the
 * desktop rail, the phone drawer, the marquee and the dashboard's brief order
 * all drop a hidden section together.
 *
 * Real assets returned on 2026-09-09 once the gateway's rwa and gas-sponsor
 * services were confirmed live in production.
 *
 * Prediction and Perpetuals returned on 2026-09-25, and the list is empty for
 * the first time. Prediction was withdrawn in #517 because the gateway's
 * `prediction` service answered 502; it answers 200 now and serves the
 * sportsbook, combo and Explore routes, so everything behind /prediction has
 * something to call again. Perps was never a backend problem, only a product
 * decision to exercise the desk on staging first; that decision is reversed.
 *
 * Both were checked against api.tsionark.com before this change, not assumed:
 * prediction's sports/filters, sports/combo-filters and markets/events all
 * answer with live fixtures, and perp's ark/assets, ark/prices and
 * ark/market-contexts all answer with live marks.
 *
 * `prediction-market`, the separate service behind user-created markets, is
 * live but currently holds no markets. That is an empty list, not a failure,
 * and the desk renders its empty state.
 *
 * To hide a section again, put its id back in this list; nothing else changes.
