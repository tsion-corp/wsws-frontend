 * buried behind a menu.
 *
 * The production square is the default, so a deployment that says nothing
 * links there, the way the API gateway defaults to production. Setting the

 * itself is a separate question, answered by SQUARE_SECTIONS_HIDDEN below.
 * The two were one switch until the rail and the dashboard needed opposite
 * answers, and folding them back together brings that back.
 *
 * A visibility switch, not a removal. While it is true the entry renders
 * nothing, and everything behind it stays wired, so the square's own
 * deployment is still reachable at its URL and the proxy in
 * `app/api/market-square` still serves the broadcast flows that need it.
 *
 * On by default, off only when said so, the way the launch gate's takedown
 * works (NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ACTIVE in lib/launch-gate.ts): setting
 * NEXT_PUBLIC_MARKET_SQUARE_LIVE to exactly "false" closes the square in that
 * environment without a code change. Any other value, including none, is on.
 * The URL stays the real precondition: without a destination every entry is
 * a dead link, so a deployment that sets NEXT_PUBLIC_MARKET_SQUARE_URL to an
 * empty string shows nothing whatever the switch says.
 *
 * Both are inlined at build like every NEXT_PUBLIC_ value, so flipping either
 * means a redeploy, which is also what makes them tamper-proof at runtime.
