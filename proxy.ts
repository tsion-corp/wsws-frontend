// the pages the closed site serves is turned away, so typing /dashboard (or
// any other path) by hand goes nowhere. The clock is read on every request, so
// the site opens itself at NEXT_PUBLIC_LAUNCH_AT without a redeploy. The
// client-side gate swaps the film for the countdown and gates the landing
// CTAs; this one backstops direct navigation, which no client check can.
//
// The two closed states are turned away differently, because they mean
// different things to a crawler:
//
//   Pre-launch redirects to the landing page. There is nothing at those URLs
//   yet, and 302-to-marketing is the honest answer.
//
//   Maintenance rewrites in place and answers 503. The URLs are real and will
//   work again within the hour, so the address stays in the bar (a bookmarked
//   /portfolio comes back on refresh rather than dumping the user home) and
//   crawlers are told to come back rather than that the page has moved.
