// The one place that knows how to move between app sections: a section listed
// in SECTION_ROUTES is a real route, so it always navigates there; every other
// section is a scroll-spy anchor that only exists on /portfolio, so it scrolls
// in-page when already there and otherwise navigates to /portfolio#id first.
//
// Every service now has a page of its own, so the anchor path carries just the
// portfolio. The portfolio still renders an anchored brief per service, which
// is what a /portfolio#spot link from outside the app lands on.
//
// A voice buy/sell passes an optional `prefill`, encoded as URL query params so
// the target section opens its trade form staged (the user then confirms). When
// a prefill is present we always push the URL (even if already on /portfolio) so
// the section can read the params; without one we keep the lighter in-page
// scroll.
//
// Extracted from DashboardShell so the shell's chrome and the voice command
// dispatcher share a single implementation instead of drifting apart. The id is
// typed string (the shell's nav callbacks pass a plain string) and validated
// here, so an unrecognized id is a safe no-op rather than a bad route push.
