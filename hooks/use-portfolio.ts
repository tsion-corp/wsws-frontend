// (the ~30 refetchFresh / refetchUntilChanged call sites), a detected incoming
// deposit, or a manual refresh. There is still no steady background poll: a
// balance that is whole and recent costs nothing to show
// (supersedes ADR-2026-09-09-portfolio-polling-at-scale).
//
// What a cached value must never do is outlive its own truth. A snapshot taken
// while a chain was unreachable, or a read that failed outright, used to stay
// on screen until the user found the refresh icon, which is how people ended up
// with no balance at all. So three things re-read on their own: a value older
// than BALANCE_STALE_MS when a screen mounts, the tab is focused or the network
// returns; a failed read, at ERROR_RETRY_MS until it lands; and an incomplete
// snapshot, below.
//
// An INCOMPLETE snapshot means a network did not answer, leaving the total a
