// is a different setting from Shine on perps.
//
// The record lives on the account (app/api/preferences), not on the device.
// It is read here through React Query, keyed on the signed-in Privy DID, so
// two accounts in one browser can never read each other's answers and the
// previous account's copy is dropped from the cache the moment the DID
// changes.
//
// The key is deliberately absent from PERSISTED_PREFIXES (lib/query-persist).
// A localStorage snapshot outlives the session and is not cleared on sign
// out, which is the same shared-device problem that put this preference on
// the account in the first place. A stale snapshot saying "on" would also be
// the worst thing to act on.

 *
 * Re-exported because the toggle and the service pages address a service by
 * this name, and they talk to the hook rather than to lib/shine.
 *
 * app/api/preferences/route.ts keeps a third copy on purpose. It is the trust
