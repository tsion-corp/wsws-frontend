// Source map upload is OFF unless explicitly asked for, and that default is
// deliberate rather than lazy.
//
// Uploading maps is what turns an issue from a stack of minified frames into
// something readable, so we do want it eventually. But the first build with it
// enabled hung: `sentry-cli sourcemaps upload` sat against
// watchtower-logger.vercel.app and never returned. The cause was a leftover
// sentry.io account in .env; its SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN was enough to make the
// plugin attempt a real upload, against a host that could not authenticate it.
// A build step that can hang is a broken CI pipeline, and a telemetry tool must
// not be able to stop a release.
//
// Hence the WATCHTOWER_ names below rather than the plugin's conventional
// SENTRY_ ones. The rename is the actual fix for that incident: the plugin
// picks SENTRY_* up from the environment on its own, so as long as we read
// those, any stray token in any environment can silently switch uploading back
// on. Reading our own names means nothing happens unless we ask for it.
//
// Watchtower's upload endpoint now speaks the Sentry /api/0 protocol, so the
// upload is enabled again. The switch is the presence of an org token rather
// than a separate flag: a token only exists where an upload is wanted, which is
// CI, and a laptop or a preview without one still builds and simply ships no
// maps. One knob, and it is the credential itself.
